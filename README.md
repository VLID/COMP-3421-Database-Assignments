# Database Assignments
## Introduction

I use MySQL to create a demo database for toy web-based sales business. It enables managers to track inventory and orders of product, analyze employee performance and manage customer relationship. It also helps the business with geographical marketing strategies towards inventory and customers through country data. I also use the B-tree algorithm to sort large datasets in the database.
